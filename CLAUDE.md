# CLAUDE.md: working on MyTVPlayer

MyTVPlayer is an Android TV IPTV player that also runs on phones and tablets by touch. It's written in Kotlin with Compose for TV, Media3/ExoPlayer and Room.
- Modules: `app` (Android) and `core` (pure Kotlin: parsers, key mapping, Xtream client).
- The repo is `biskyt/MyTVPlayer` on GitHub. It moved from `biskyt/tvapp`, which still redirects.

## Standing instructions from the owner
- **Run `/simplify` and `/code-review` before every commit.**
  - Apply their findings, or note why one is skipped.
  - Never commit first and review afterwards.
- **No test APKs unless asked.** CI builds no APK on pushes; APKs are built only for release tags. Build a debug APK
  only when the owner asks for one.
- **Steer clear of any reference to, or hint of, piracy.** This applies to code, docs, store text, changelog and commit messages.
- **Keep overhead and risk low.** Prefer small, well-tested changes, and don't widen a release on your own initiative.
- **Flaky tests must be root-caused and fixed.**
  - Don't re-run CI hoping for green.
  - Never skip, disable or quarantine a test.
  - Don't just raise timeouts.
- **Long waits (CI, test loops, agents) go in the background**, so the conversation isn't blocked.
- **When the owner says "don't release until X", don't merge or release** until they confirm.
- **Only the app's own text is translated**: see **Languages** below.
- **Release notes are English only**, on GitHub and in Play's "What's new" (translated Play notes: not worth the work).

## Process for each change or release
1. Make the change with tests. Check that a new test fails without the fix.
2. Run the CI checks locally:
   - `./gradlew ktlintCheck detekt lintDebug`
   - `./gradlew :core:test :app:testDebugUnitTest`
   - `./gradlew ktlintFormat` fixes most style issues. Rerun `ktlintCheck` afterwards, because the format task itself exits non-zero when it changed something.
3. Run `/simplify`, then `/code-review`, then apply their fixes.
4. Bump `versionCode` (+1) and `versionName` in `app/build.gradle.kts`, for every PR that changes the app, released or
   not: the patch number for fixes and small changes, the minor for a notable feature (1.1.0: languages).
5. Add a `## x.y.z` section at the top of `CHANGELOG.md`, written for people using the app.
   - A release's notes are its section plus those of any unreleased versions since the last release
     (`.github/scripts/release-notes.sh`). For Play's "What's new" (500 characters), `play-notes.py` keeps the whole
     bullets that fit in about 420 and adds a link to the full notes, so put the change users notice most first.
   - Fix a published GitHub release's notes with the **Release notes** workflow (`release-notes.yml`, input `tag`),
     which rewrites them from CHANGELOG.md without rebuilding. It doesn't touch Play: change Play's notes in Play
     Console.
6. Commit with the session's attribution trailers, then push to the working branch and open a PR to `main`.
7. When CI is green on both the push and PR runs, merge the PR (merge commit).
   - CI runs `:core:test :app:recordRoborazziDebug` (the unit tests, recording screenshots to `app/screenshots/`; don't
     commit those unless meant to). The emulator runs are on PRs (or started by hand), and skipped only when every
     changed file is `.md`, `docs/` or `store/`.
8. Releases are built only for a tag, never for a plain merge to `main`. When the owner wants one, start `release.yml`
   for `v<versionName>` on `main`. It re-tests, signs and publishes the GitHub release with the APK and SHA256SUMS.
   - **From a Claude session, run the workflow by hand:** tag pushes from a cloud session have failed with HTTP 403
     (with either repo name as the remote), while pushes to the working branch work. Use the GitHub MCP tool
     `actions_run_trigger` with method `run_workflow`, `workflow_id` `release.yml` and ref `main`. It tags
     `v<versionName>` itself.
   - **Check first** that the version bump is merged to `main`, and that neither a release nor a tag `v<versionName>`
     exists yet (`get_release_by_tag`, `list_tags`). A hand-started run doesn't check the version. It would update an
     existing release, or publish onto a stale tag left by a failed run (delete that tag first).
   - From a normal checkout, pushing the tag also works: `git tag v1.0.2 && git push origin v1.0.2`.
   - A change with no app changes (CI, tests, docs) is merged without a version bump, changelog entry or release.
   - The signed Play bundle (`.aab`) goes to Play's closed testing track, and is a run artifact called
     `MyTVPlayer-<version>-play-bundle`, kept 90 days.
   - Versions `0.x` (or dev-key signed builds) are pre-releases. `1.x` and later are full releases.
9. Confirm the release exists (`get_release_by_tag`), then give the owner the release link and the `.aab` artifact link
   (`actions_list` with method `list_workflow_run_artifacts` and the release run's id). For when testers see it, see
   RELEASING.md › Google Play.

## Working from a Claude Code cloud session
- **GitHub tools:** use owner `biskyt`, repo `MyTVPlayer`. The old name `tvapp` redirects for most calls, but
  `check_repo_access` reports it as not connected.
- **CI results:** for each PR, call `subscribe_pr_activity` (repo `MyTVPlayer`) so its CI results wake the session.
  - Each run (CI on push, CI on the PR, the emulators) reports on its own: merge only when all are green, checking
    them with `pull_request_read` (`get_check_runs`). The push run may finish before the PR is opened.
  - Keep one `send_later` check as a safety net (CI and the emulator runs take about 5 minutes). Use it alone for runs
    outside a PR (a release, about 6 minutes; release notes) or if another agent already watches the PR.
- `merge_pull_request`'s `expectedHeadSha` needs the full 40-character SHA.
- Work on the session's designated branch. Once its PR is merged, restart the branch from `origin/main` for any
  follow-up (`git checkout -B <branch> origin/main`); never stack new work on merged history.
- The local `main` can be stale: compare with `origin/main` after `git fetch origin main`.

## Languages (since 1.1.0)
- The app's languages are `AppText.languages`, with UK English the default in `values/`. Strings are split by area
  (`strings_<area>.xml`).
  - Every new string needs es, pt-BR and fr translations. If the US wording differs, it also needs entries in
    `values-en-rUS` and `values-en-rGB` (see the comment there).
  - A new language needs a `values-<qualifier>` folder, an entry in `AppText.languages` and one in
    `androidResources.localeFilters` in `app/build.gradle.kts`. Otherwise release builds drop its strings;
    `EnglishStringsTest` checks this.
- **Text the app defines** comes from string resources: `stringResource` in composables, `appString` / `appPlural`
  (AppText.kt) elsewhere.
- **Text from users, playlists and guides is shown as it is:** playlist, guide, channel and category names, titles.
- **Saved data stays language-neutral.** The app saves blank values, ids or codes and names them when shown:
  `programmeTitle`, `categoryLabel` / `.label`, `GuideError.text`, `groupLabel` (in `data/CoreText.kt`) and the episode
  and season names. Never save app words (an English "Other" or "No title" was saved before 1.1.0). `SavedTextTest`
  covers this.
- **Check that translated text fits** with the store screenshots in a language:
  `./gradlew :app:recordRoborazziDebug --tests '*StoreAssetsTest*' -PstoreAssets -PstoreLanguage=<tag>` writes them to
  `app/build/store-assets/<tag>/`. Without `-PstoreLanguage` it rewrites the committed store listing assets
  (`store/graphics` and `store/screenshots`).

## Gotchas learned the hard way
- **Android regex is ICU, not Java.** A bare `}` in a regex passes on the JVM (where Robolectric runs) but crashes on devices. That crashed M3U setup in 0.9.5. `core/src/test/.../RegexPortabilityTest.kt` checks every `Regex(...)` literal. Escape braces.
- **Robolectric UI tests:**
  - **Compose rules:** use `createUiComposeRule()` / `createUiComposeRule<Activity>()` from `testutil/ComposeRules.kt`, not `createComposeRule()`.
    - The plain rule runs effects on an unconfined dispatcher. Room flows collected with `collectAsState` then resume on Room's `arch_disk_io` threads and race the main thread's recomposition, so updates get lost now and then.
    - That was the cause of the long-running Catch-up tab / category flakes. The real app is unaffected.
  - Clear each test's `Navigator` (its ViewModelStores) at teardown with the `Navigators` rule
    (`@get:Rule(order = Navigators.ORDER)`, in testutil/Navigators.kt): otherwise ViewModels and ExoPlayers from earlier
    tests keep running into later ones.
  - `TestApp.onTerminate` runs the main looper down before Robolectric resets it: Compose's `AndroidUiDispatcher.Main`
    is a process-wide lazy, and if Robolectric drops its posted run it never posts again, so every later test's paged
    lists (`collectAsLazyPagingItems`) stay empty. That made failures depend on which test ran before.
  - `createUiComposeRule` reads kotlinx-coroutines-test's private `dispatchEvents` by reflection (no public hook in
    1.10.2; an IdlingResource isn't consulted by performScrollToNode, which then loops until out of memory). A
    coroutines upgrade that renames it fails every UI test at once.
  - **Waits:** go through `waitAdvancingClock(stepMs)` in `testutil/UiWait.kt`, because the main looper is paused. Use step 0 to run due work, and a step greater than 0 when delayed work (debounces, timeouts) must happen.
  - **Settings outlive a test:** the settings DataStore is process-wide, so set what a test relies on in its `setUp`.
  - **A panel is its own window:** `SidePanel` dialogs are separate windows. Send keys to the right root (`onAllNodes(isRoot())`).
  - **Thread dumps on timeout:** `otherThreads()` in UiWait.kt dumps the other threads when a wait times out.
- **Detekt limits:**
  - `AppUiTest` is near `LargeClass` (600 lines), so put new UI tests in their own class.
  - Composables near the complexity limit: `CategoryColumn`, `GuideGrid`, `AppRoot`.
- **Performance tests assert allocations, not CPU time:** CPU time grows with other test JVMs running alongside, as
  in CI and release (see `ProgrammeKindTest`).
- **Reproducing a flaky test:** Gradle's build cache replays test results. Use `--no-build-cache` with
  `:core:cleanTest :app:cleanTestDebugUnitTest`, and run core and app tests together, as release does.
- **M3U category ids** carry history from before 1.1.0 (see `M3uCategories`).
  - If you change how M3U titles are filed or given ids, map the new ids to the old ones (as `M3uCategories.oldId` /
    `inherited` do), so hidden categories, favourites and progress are kept.
  - Also bump `M3uVod.FILING`, so each playlist's films and series reload once.
- **Touch:** tv-material `Surface` only answers D-pad OK. Taps are wired through `LocalTouch` and `Modifier.onTap` / `onPlainTap` / `onAnyTouch` in `ui/common/Touch.kt`.
- **Never run `pkill -f <pattern>`** where the pattern also appears in your own command line, because it kills your own shell. Kill background loops by PID.
- **Network from the sandbox and from GitHub runners:** archive.org isn't reachable from either, so the app can't be tested against it from here. Wikimedia is reachable.
- **Android TV stand-in pickers:** some TVs (e.g. the owner's, on Android TV 10) ship stand-in "pickers" that only say "no application can handle this request".
  - The backup screen opens a picker directly only if it's Android's own (`…documentsui`). Otherwise it offers the installed file managers.
  - MyTVPlayer also accepts backup files via Open with / Share (JSON).
- **User-Agent:** every stream and download sends `MyTVPlayer/<version> (+https://github.com/biskyt/MyTVPlayer)`. Wikimedia requires an identifying UA. A per-entry `http-user-agent` in an M3U overrides it for live channels.
  - Films and episodes from M3U feeds don't store a per-entry UA yet. That was offered and isn't done.

## The owner's setup and the free playlist
- **Owner's devices:** they test on a TV running Android TV 10 and an Android phone. The phone needs the touch UI.
- **The free channels, films and series** come from the owner's own playlist project, https://biskyt.github.io/legalFreeIPTVplaylist/, with its own EPG at `epg.xml.gz`.
  - Films are hosted on archive.org and upload.wikimedia.org.
  - Its group titles carry prefixes ("Movies: Open Movies"). The app doesn't add them.

## Product decisions from the owner
These are built in already. Keep them when changing the areas they cover.
- **Audio passthrough** (Dolby Atmos and other surround formats go to the soundbar or TV) is on by default, with a
  setting to turn it off.
- **Subtitles** default to forced subtitles only, in the system language. Settings choose the default language or
  turn subtitles off.
- **Back stops playback.** There's no picture-in-picture.
- **Text fields are built for a TV remote:**
  - Server addresses get no autocorrect or capitals.
  - Passwords are shown, not hidden.
  - The keyboard's Next moves to the next field.
- **Options menu:** holding OK opens it, and so does the remote's Info/Menu button. Releasing OK must not also start
  playback.
- **Backup:**
  - Backup is one plain JSON file with a fixed name, overwritten each time, and no encryption or schedule.
  - Permissions are asked for only when backing up or restoring.
- **Licences** aren't a reason to avoid the best library.

## Open items (as of 1.1.0, released)
- **Google Play:** each release uploads the `.aab` to closed testing (`alpha`); set-up is in RELEASING.md. Production is
  promoted by hand in Play Console.
- **Done:** emulator smoke tests on CI for pull requests (`.github/workflows/emulator.yml`: Android TV 9 and Google TV
  16, free on GitHub's standard runners for a public repo). Tests live in `app/src/androidTest`; the debug build adds an
  x86/x86_64 ABI only with `-PemulatorAbi=<arch>`. `.github/scripts/start-emulator.sh` boots the emulator itself:
  Google TV 16 drops off adb for a second or two after boot, which the usual runner action doesn't wait out.
- **Optional:** per-entry user agent / referrer for M3U films and episodes.
