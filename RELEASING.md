# Releasing MyPlexPlayer

Releases are built and published by GitHub Actions (`.github/workflows/release.yml`). Each one is a GitHub Release with:
- `MyPlexPlayer-<version>.apk`: for sideloading onto a TV box.
- `SHA256SUMS.txt`: the APK's checksum.

The app bundle Google Play wants (`MyPlexPlayer-<version>.aab`) isn't published with the release. It is uploaded to Google Play's closed testing track (see **Google Play** below) and kept on the workflow run's page under **Artifacts** for 90 days.
- Release notes taken from this version's section of `CHANGELOG.md`, plus those of any versions since the last release
  that weren't released on their own.

## One-time setup: your own signing key

Android only installs an update if it is signed with the same key as the installed app. Development builds use a public key that is checked into the repo, so a real release needs a private key that only you hold.

1. **Create the key on your own computer.** You need Java's `keytool`, which comes with Android Studio or any JDK.
   ```sh
   keytool -genkeypair -v -keystore myplexplayer-release.jks -alias myplexplayer \
     -keyalg RSA -keysize 4096 -validity 10000
   ```
   It asks for a password and your name. **Back up the `.jks` file and the password somewhere safe.** Without them you can never update the app again.
2. **Add two repository secrets** under GitHub › Settings › Secrets and variables › Actions › New repository secret:

   | Secret | Value |
   |---|---|
   | `MYPLEX_KEYSTORE_BASE64` | the output of `base64 -w0 myplexplayer-release.jks` (macOS: `base64 -i myplexplayer-release.jks`) |
   | `MYPLEX_KEYSTORE_PASSWORD` | the password you chose |

   Two more are optional, only if yours differ from the defaults: `MYPLEX_KEY_ALIAS` (default `myplexplayer`) and `MYPLEX_KEY_PASSWORD` (default: the keystore password, which is what `keytool` uses).

Until these secrets exist, releases still build, but they are signed with the public development key and marked as test pre-releases. (MyPlexPlayer's were added on 2026-10-25, from 0.3.0's release.)

> **Switching keys:** the first release signed with your key won't install over a build signed with the development key. Uninstall the old build once, then install the new one. That clears the app's settings and playlists, so add them again afterwards.

## Each release

1. **Bump the version** in `app/build.gradle.kts`: `versionCode` goes up by 1, and `versionName` gets the new number (e.g. `0.3.0`).
2. **Describe the changes** in a new `## 0.3.0` section at the top of `CHANGELOG.md`, written for the people using the app.
3. **Commit and push.**
4. **Start the release**, in either of these ways:
   - GitHub › Actions › **Release** › **Run workflow**, then pick the branch. This tags the commit `v0.3.0` for you.
   - Push the tag yourself: `git tag v0.3.0 && git push origin v0.3.0`. The tag must match `versionName`.
5. After about 10 minutes, the release appears under **Releases** on the repo page.

Versions starting with `0.` are marked as pre-releases. From `1.0.0` they are full releases.

## Google Play
Each release uploads its `.aab` to the closed testing track (**Closed testing - Alpha**), with its notes, cut to Play's 500-character limit, as "What's new". Play re-signs it with its own app-signing key, so Play installs and GitHub APK installs can't update each other. Pick one channel per device.

### One-time setup
1. **Google Cloud** (free, no billing needed): at [console.cloud.google.com](https://console.cloud.google.com/), create a project, enable the **Google Play Android Developer API**, create a service account (no roles) and download a **JSON key** for it.
2. **Play Console** › *Users and permissions* › *Invite new users*: the service account's email, with MyPlexPlayer under *App permissions* and **Release apps to testing tracks**.
3. **GitHub** › *Settings* › *Secrets and variables* › *Actions*: a secret `PLAY_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_JSON` holding the whole JSON file.

Without the secret (or for a build signed with the development key) the upload is skipped; upload the `.aab` from the run's Artifacts by hand instead.

If the upload fails after the GitHub release is published (e.g. Play answers "The service is currently unavailable"), run the **Play upload** workflow from the Actions tab with the release's tag (e.g. `v0.2.1`). It uploads that release's own bundle again, from its run's Artifacts (kept 90 days), with its "What's new"; the Release workflow itself won't run again for a version already released. If Play answers that the version code has already been used, the first upload did go through: check the release in Play Console instead.

### Repository variables (optional, same settings page, *Variables* tab)
- `PLAY_RELEASE_STATUS`: unset, each release goes to testers once Play has reviewed it. Set it to `draft` to check each one in Play Console and send it from there instead.
- `PLAY_NOTES_LANGUAGE`: the language of "What's new", `en-GB` unless set. It must be one of the store listing's languages.

A release reaches testers once Google has reviewed it, usually within a few hours. On a device, opening the Play Store
(or the app's page) makes it check for the update.

Moving a release from closed testing to production is done in Play Console.
