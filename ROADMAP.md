### "Find in Series / Movies" from the TV guide (done in 0.7.0)
In the TV guide, a programme's options menu (hold OK, or Info) offers a way to watch it on demand.

- **What the menu shows:**
  - **Series** (an episode number, or a series-type category): **Find series** opens the series, or the exact episode when it can be matched.
  - **Film:** **Find in Movies**.
  - **Clearly neither** (news, sport, live events): no option at all.
  - **Unknown:** **Search for "<title>"**, which opens search pre-filled with the title.
- **How it works:**
  - Take two things from the guide data the importer already reads: the XMLTV `<category>` and `<episode-num>` (`xmltv_ns` "S.E.P", or onscreen "S01E02").
  - Store them as a tiny `kind` (series / movie / other / unknown) plus season and episode numbers on each programme.
  - No extra downloads or lookups.
  - Search by normalised title (reusing the channel-name normaliser). It opens the series, then the episode if the season and episode numbers match.
  - If any of this turns out to be costly, fall back to the pre-filled search alone.

## Later
- Recording to USB storage (DVR).
- More touch: portrait phone layouts, foldables and player gestures (1.0 has touch in landscape).

## Not planned
PIN lock, multi-view, Stalker portals, Trakt, voice search, picture-in-picture.
