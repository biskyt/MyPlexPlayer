/**
 * Modifier that takes focus once the element is shown (and again whenever [key] changes, e.g. when data arrives),
 * so each screen opens with the remote already on its main content. Shown again (content swapped back, a panel's
 * question answered), it takes focus again.
 *
 * With [once], it takes focus once a visit to the screen: for the first item of a list that scrolls on a TV. The list
 * composes it again as it scrolls back into view, which must not take focus from the item the remote is on (the top
 * guide was skipped in TV guide sources). The visit it took focus in is kept in its saved state, which a lazy list
 * keeps while the item is out of view and drops when the item is really removed. Outside a NavHost (no visit), it
 * takes focus each time, as without it.
