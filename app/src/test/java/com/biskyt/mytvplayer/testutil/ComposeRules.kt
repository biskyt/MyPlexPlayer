 * it does in the app.
 *
 * The plain rules run it on an UnconfinedTestDispatcher, where a coroutine carries on on whichever thread resumed it.
 * A Room flow resumes its collector on Room's query thread (arch_disk_io_*); the state it writes then wakes the
 * recomposer on that thread too, which records the change into the composition while the main thread may be
 * composing it. Now and then the change was lost: the UI never showed what the database had (no Catch-up tab, a
 * stale selected category), however long a test waited.

 * unless a frame is due: scrolling to a node, for one, would then never finish.
 *
 * Compose 1.8's public hooks don't do it: an IdlingResource that runs the queue isn't asked while scrolling to a node
 * (which then loops until out of memory), and a TestDispatcher can't be subclassed or wrapped (the rule replaces any
 * other interceptor with an unconfined one). So the scheduler's queue notices are read directly; if a
 * kotlinx-coroutines-test upgrade renames them, every UI test fails at once (NoSuchFieldException), not now and then.
 * The consumer is stopped when the test ends (see [stopMainThreadEffects]), so work resumed late can't run in the next.
